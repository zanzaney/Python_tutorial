Q. What is the difference between an interpreted and a compiled language?
A. Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute.
   Hence, they tend to be faster than interpreted languages. They also allow more control over 
   the memory management and the CPU usage. In interpreted languages, interpreter runs through 
   a program line by line and executes the code.
Q. What is an interpreter?
A. It is a computer program that directly runs the given code without compiling it in a machine 
   language program.
Q. Why are double quotes used in print command?
A. They are used to print strings. Single quotes can also be used.
Q. What are variables?
A. They are just placeholders that store objects to a word or a name meaningful to us.
Q. What are objects?
A. Objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and
   they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process.
Q. What are tuples?
A. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas.
Q. What is the difference between a tuple and a list?
A. A tuple is immutable whereas a list is mutable,i.e, values can be added, subtracted, from a 
   list, the list can also be appended. But, a tuple stays as it was defined earlier,i.e,
   it cannot be modified.
Q. How are tuples and strings differentiated?
A. The values contained by a tuple are enclosed within parehthesis (). The values 
   contained by a list are enclosed within square brackets[].
Q. Why don't variables have to be declared in Python?
A. That is because Python is a dynamically typed language.
